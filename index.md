## About Me
I am a Research Scientist at Meta (GenAI Llama; previously FAIR). Prior to that, I obtained my Ph.D. in Biostatistics at [University of Pittsburgh](https://publichealth.pitt.edu/biostatistics) in 2022, advised by [Lu Tang](https://publichealth.pitt.edu/home/directory/lu-tang) and [Gong Tang](https://publichealth.pitt.edu/home/directory/gong-tang). I was a visiting student in Computer Science at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/) from 2019 to 2021. I obtained my B.S. in Pharmacy and Computer Science at [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/) in 2018. 

My research interest lies in developing novel statistical and machine learning methods in <font color='#000000'>causal inference</font>, <font color='#000000'>data integration</font>, and <font color='#000000'>decision fairness</font>.
<!-- <strong>data integration</strong>, and <strong>decision fairness</strong>.  -->

I had been a Graduate student researcher at [NRG Oncology](https://www.nrgoncology.org/) during my PhD. I interned at [Eli Lilly and Company](https://www.lilly.com/) in summer 2021 working with [Shu Yang](https://shuyang.wordpress.ncsu.edu/) and [Ilya Lipkovich](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=m4bEhasAAAAJ&hl=en). I also worked with [Timothy Girard](https://ccm.pitt.edu/?q=content/girard-timothy) at Department of Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh. 

I enjoy volunteering. As well as being am a weekly cat care volunteer at [Humane Animal Rescue](https://www.humaneanimalrescue.org/), I was a pro-bono consultant at [Fourth River Solutions](http://www.fourthriversolutions.org/) for local businesses in Pittsburgh. I worked as a data science project reviewer in a global team at [DataKind](https://www.datakind.org/) to help identify impactful and innovative proposals that will help spur inclusive growth during the pandemic in summer 2020.
