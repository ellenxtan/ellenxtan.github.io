## About Me
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Biostatistics at University of Pittsburgh, advised by [Lu Tang](https://publichealth.pitt.edu/home/directory/lu-tang) and [Gong Tang](https://publichealth.pitt.edu/home/directory/gong-tang). I was a visiting student in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University from 2019 to 2021. I obtained my B.S. in Pharmacy and Computer Science at Sun Yat-sen University in 2018. 

My research interest lies in developing novel statistical and machine learning methods in <strong>causal inference</strong>, <strong>data integration</strong>, and <strong>decision fairness</strong>. 

I am currently a Graduate student researcher at [NRG Oncology](https://www.nrgoncology.org/). I interned at [Eli Lilly and Company](https://www.lilly.com/) working with [Shu Yang](https://shuyang.wordpress.ncsu.edu/) and [Ilya Lipkovich](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=m4bEhasAAAAJ&hl=en) in summer 2021. I also work with [Timothy Girard](https://ccm.pitt.edu/?q=content/girard-timothy) at Department of Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh. 

I enjoy volunteering. As well as being am a weekly cat care volunteer at [Humane Animal Rescue](https://www.humaneanimalrescue.org/), I am a pro-bono consultant at [Fourth River Solutions](http://www.fourthriversolutions.org/) for local businesses in Pittsburgh. I worked as a data science project reviewer in a global team at [DataKind](https://www.datakind.org/) to help identify impactful and innovative proposals that will help spur inclusive growth during the pandemic in summer 2020.
